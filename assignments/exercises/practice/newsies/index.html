    <section>“Derivative.” It sounds complicated, and you may have heard it in a negative context before. But what
        does it mean when it comes to quilting? First, let’s define the word. According to the Oxford dictionary, a
        derivative is “(typically of an artist or work of art) imitative of the work of another person; originating
        from, based on, or influenced by.” In the quilt world, this means that if you make a quilt using someone
        else’s pattern, artwork, photography, or quilt design, it’s a derivative.</section>

    <section>Ever heard the phrase “inspiration is everywhere?” If you’re looking at all, it is. We are bombarded with
        inspiration: on Instagram, in quilt shows, and all over the Internet. Modern art and graphic design are
        ripe with inspiration for modern quilts.
